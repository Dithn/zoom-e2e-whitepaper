# Zoom Cryptography Whitepaper
This is the home of the whitepaper documenting the cryptographic design powering several Zoom
products, including end-to-end encryption for emails, phone and meetings. The latest released PDF will always be [available
here](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/master/zoom_e2e.pdf). This repository will be
updated as we implement and iterate on our cryptographic protocols.

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for a summary of what changed in each version. Note that, before
version 4.0, this document was titled "E2E Encryption for Zoom Meetings", but we updated the name to
reflect its expanded scope. We still value feedback, recommendation and corrections. Please continue
to post them under [Issues](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/issues).
