# Zoom End-to-End Encryption Whitepaper
This is the home of the whitepaper documenting Zoom's planned end-to-end encryption system. The latest released PDF will always be [available here](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/master/zoom_e2e.pdf). This repository will be updated as we implement and iterate our cryptographic design.

The public comment period for the initial design will be open from *22 May 2020* through *5 June 2020*. We ask that any recommendations or comments be posted under [Issues](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/issues).
