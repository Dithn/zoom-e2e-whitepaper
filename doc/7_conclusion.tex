\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed a roadmap for bringing end-to-end encryption technology to Zoom Meetings (as that term is best understood by security experts). At a high level, the approach is simple: use public key cryptography to distribute a session key to a meeting's participants; and provide increasingly stronger bindings between public keys and user identities. However, the devil is in the details, as user identity across multiple devices is a challenging problem, and has user experience implications. We proposed a phased deployment of E2E security, with each successive stage giving stronger protections. The crux of the proposal are: (1) delegated authority to SSOs where applicable; (2) signed chains of cryptographic statements (sigchains) for user devices and contact lists; and (3) a privacy-preserving ``transparency tree'' to tie them tightly together.

We thank all reviewers for feedback during the initial public review period.

We will continue to incorporate feedback and publish subsequent drafts as we refine, implement and deploy these ideas.
